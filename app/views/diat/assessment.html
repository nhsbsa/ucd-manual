        <h2>What happens at the assessment</h2>
        <p>NHSBSA assessments are peer reviews and build on the work your team is already doing with their professional communities.</p>


        <p>They are run by a panel of 4 or 5 assessors, including a lead assessor, a user researcher, a designer and a technical lead.</p>

        <p>At the assessment, you’ll need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>give a brief overview of the service</li>
            <li>show the end-to-end journey</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You’ll then show how the service meets the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Digital Service Standard</a> by answering questions about:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>user needs</li>
            <li>design</li>
            <li>technology</li>
            <li>your team</li>
            <li>analytics and key performance indicators</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You don’t need to prepare extra material, you’ll be able to use materials you’ve already built for show and tells.</p>

        <h2>Getting your result</h2>

        <p>You’ll get your result within 5 working days of the assessment.</p>

        <p>What happens next depends on the result of the assessment and the development phase your service is in.</p>
